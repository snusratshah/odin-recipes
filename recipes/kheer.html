        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kheer is a traditional South Asian rice pudding that’s slow-cooked to creamy perfection. Made with milk, rice, and sugar, and 
            flavored with cardamom and nuts, it's a beloved dessert often served on festivals, weddings, and special occasions.</p>
        <p>Its charm lies in its simplicity and the patience it requires—slow simmering allows the milk to reduce and thicken, giving 
            kheer its luxurious texture. Variations include adding condensed milk, raisins, or aromatic essences like kewra or rosewater.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 liter full-fat milk</li>
            <li>½ cup rice (soaked for 30 minutes)</li>
            <li>½ cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>3–4 green cardamoms</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped almonds and pistachios</li>
            <li>A pinch of saffron or kewra water (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a heavy-bottom pan, bring milk and cardamoms to a boil. Add soaked rice.</li>
            <li>Cook on low heat, stirring frequently, until rice is completely soft and the milk is reduced and thick.</li>
            <li>Add sugar, mix well, and cook for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with nuts and saffron or kewra water. Serve chilled or warm.</li>
